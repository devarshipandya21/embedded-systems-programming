# Emebedded Systems Programming
This involves all the work that I have done in the domain of programming embedded systems using Arduino Uno microcontroller.

# LED & Buzzer Interfacing
* ESDI1.1: Flash/toggle/on off single LED.
* ESDI1.2: Flash/toggle/on off eigESDI LEDs.
* ESDI1.3: Interface 8 LEDs. Out of Four LED ON and Four LED OFF.
* ESDI1.4: Alternate ON OFF eigESDI LED.
* ESDI1.5: Interface 8 LEDs. Generate left series patterns.
* ESDI1.6: Interface 8 LEDs. Generate rigESDI series patterns.
* ESDI1.7: Interface 8 LEDs. Generate left and rigESDI series patterns.
* ESDI1.8: Combine all above in single program
* ESDI1.9: Display 00 to FF on LED
* ESDI1.10: Sound the buzzer every 1 second.
